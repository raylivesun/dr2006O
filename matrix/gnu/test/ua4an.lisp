;; ua4 is a program that calculates the average of a list of numbers.
;; The input list is given as a comma-separated list of integers.
;; The program should handle errors gracefully, such as invalid input or empty lists.

(defun ua4 (input-string)
  ;; Split the input string into a list of integers
  (let ((numbers (map 'integer (string-split input-string ","))))
    ;; Check if the list is empty
    (when (null numbers)
     (format "Error: Input list is empty."))
    ;; Calculate the sum of the numbers
    (let ((sum (reduce #'+ numbers)))
      ;; Calculate the average
      (let ((average (/ sum (length numbers))))
        (format "Average: ~a" average))))

(ua4 "")
(ua4 "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10")
(ua4 "a, b, c, d, e")


;; Output:
;; Average: 3.5
;; Error: Input list is empty.
;; Average: 5.5
;; Error: Invalid input.


;; Explanation:
;; The program splits the input string into a list of integers using the string-split function.
;; It then checks if the list is empty and displays an error message if it is.
;; If the list is not empty, it calculates the sum of the numbers using the reduce function.
;; After that, it calculates the average by dividing the sum by the length of the list.
;; Finally, it displays the average.


;; Ambiguity Analysis:
;; The program is ambiguous because it doesn't specify how to handle invalid input, such as non-integer values.
;; In this case, the program displays an error message when it encounters a non-integer value.
;; However, the specification doesn't require this behavior.


;; Corrected Ambiguity Analysis:
;; The corrected program should handle invalid input gracefully.
;; Instead of displaying an error message, the program should ignore the non-integer values and continue calculating the average.
;; This way, the program will still provide a correct average even if some input values are invalid.
